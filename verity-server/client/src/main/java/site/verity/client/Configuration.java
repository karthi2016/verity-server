/**
 * VerityReputation
 * This is a simple Verity reputation API. You can find out more about Verity at <a href='http://getcrystal.net'>http://getcrystal.net</a>  For this sample, you can use the api key 'special-key' for tests that need authorization (authorization filters).  Where possible we specify multi-hashes as unique identifiers that can be used by distributed cryptographically secure systems (blockchains) Where possible we specify hyper-media links (e.g. JSON-LD) to describe data that is linked in graph structures by nature (blockchain data, IPFS data, etc.)  Agents, Entity and Activity should map to provenance ontology described in https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o Transaction is an implementation that maps to TrustAtoms. https://github.com/CoMakery/trust-exchange/blob/master/README.md This is a simple Verity reputation API.
